	  mpegtsmux: Caps event fails with stream type change error
	  If mpegtsmux receives the same caps again, it wrongly claims the stream
	  type changed:
	  error: Stream type change from 06 to 8f not supported
	  This adds a unit test that demonstrate the issue in the very hacky way.
	  I have seen this happening with the below pipeline when upstream caps
	  changes. Since the caps filter fixates the caps received by opusenc and
	  mpegtsmux, the stream type cannot change.

	  The TsMuxStream internal_stream_type field stores the original
	  'full' stream type (such as Opus), while the stream_type field
	  stores the value that will actually be written into the MPEG-TS
	  packets according to the codec mappings. When checking if
	  input caps are changing stream type, check the original type.

	* ext/curl/gstcurlsmtpsink.c:
	  curlsmtpsink: adapt to date formatting issue
	  In glib 2.73.1, padding for %e in gdatetime was changed from "space"
	  to the Unicode character (U+2007). This violates rfc5322 (Internet
	  Message Format), which states that a message shall be composed of
	  characters in the range of 1 through 127 and interpreted as US-ASCII
	  characters. Hence, when using g_date_time_format, it is necessary to
	  instead write %_e to enforce space padding.

	  analytics: always add GstTensorMeta
	  Always add GstTensorMeta to buffer instead of re-using existing GstTensorMeta
	  when it's already present. The reason for the change is when we have cascaded
	  inference elements overwriting (tflite) or leaking (ONNX) GstTensorMeta when we
	  have cascaded inferences. We didn't create and API to append to GstTensorMeta
	  and I think it's more convenient to have a new GstTensorMeta for each
	  inferences. It's also more clear that a group of tensor was produced by one
	  inference but doesn't limit tensordecoders from using tensors produced by
	  multiple inference. I don't see much value in having all tensors data always
	  inside one GstTensorMeta since appending would mean re-allocation of the tensors
	  array anyway.

	* sys/decklink/gstdecklinkvideosrc.cpp:
	  decklinkvideosrc: fix decklinkvideosrc becomes unrecoverable if it fails to start streaming
	  See #2611
	  When transitioning to PLAYING we call IDeckLinkInput::StartStreams() (via GstDecklinkInput::start_streams). This can
	  fail for various reasons, including if the hardware device is already in use.
	  Previously, we logged StartStreams() failure as an element error but otherwise continued to successfully transition to
	  PLAYING. Now, if StartStreams() returns an error we fail the state change.
	  If StartStreams() fails then a subsequent call to StopStreams(), when transitioning PAUSED to READY, will also fail.
	  Previously, if StopStreams() failed then the state change also failed. Unfortunately this prevented the element from
	  later being disposed, which in turn meant the associated hardware resources was never freed. Consequently, if a
	  decklinkvideosrc failed to transition PAUSED to READY, then the associated hardware device could not subsequently be
	  used by any other decklinkvideosrc.
	  Now, we log an element error if StopStreams() fails but otherwise consider the state change to have succeeded. This
	  means that the element can be disposed and the associated hardware resource released.

	  vkphysicaldevice: silence validation for features
	  With merge request !9438 the validation layer started to complain with
	  VUID-VkDeviceCreateInfo-pNext-02829
	  This patch fixes this ill-usage of Vulkan API, by removing the feature enabling
	  of sampler ycbcr conversion, since it was promoted since Vulkan 1.1, and in
	  GStreamer is only used in Vulkan Video operations, which are only enabled in
	  Vulkan 1.3+.
	  Also, these features detection and enabling were moved to a function called when
	  filling the physical device data, in order to check the API version of the
	  device driver before adding the enabling of the feature.
	  Finally, the getters were adapted to use the version feature structure if the
	  device driver version matches.

	* gst-libs/gst/vulkan/gstvkphysicaldevice-private.h:
	* gst-libs/gst/vulkan/gstvkphysicaldevice.c:
	  vkphysicaldevice: enable sampler ycbcr, sync2 and timeline semaphore features
	  For the features VkPhysicalDeviceSamplerYcbcrConversionFeaturesKHR,
	  VkPhysicalDeviceSynchronization2Features and
	  VkPhisicalDeviceTimelineSemaphoreFeatures
	  The Vulkan specification states:
	  If the `VkPhysicalDeviceXXXFeatures` structure is included in the `pNext`
	  chain of the `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` structure passed to
	  `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2`, it is filled in to indicate whether each
	  corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a
	  `VkDevice` with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceXXXFeatures`,
	  it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members
	  set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of `VkDeviceCreateInfo` when creating
	  the `VkDevice`.
	  And that was missing in the code.
	  Strangely, that functionality doesn't have a Valid-Usage ID assigned, so it
	  isn't caught by the validation layer.
	  This patch adds the structures in the physical devices to get them and later set
	  them in the device creation.
	  In order to link these features, videomaintenance1, and others to come, without
	  knowing if Vulkan 1.3 features are chained in the device properties structure, a
	  static and inlined function was added in gstvkphysicaldevice-private.h. It was
	  added in a header file to avoid compiler warnings if it's not used because of
	  old Vulkan headers.
	  Also the value dump videomaintenance1 was moved to another function to pack
	  there all these queried features.

	  decklink: calculate internal using values closer to the current clock times
	  In a previous version of the clock time conversion code, scheduled playback used
	  to be started (from 0) when transitioning to PLAYING and stopped when
	  transitioning PLAYING->PAUSED. This worked fine when converting running times
	  using the internal clock.  However, now the decklink clock will produce values
	  that are monotonically increasing and do not reset to 0 at the same moments as
	  running time anymore. This means that the clock adjustments could attempt to
	  convert a small running time based on a large clock time e.g. after pausing
	  for many hours. As the adjustment code is a simple linear interpolation based on
	  the current clock times (large) using the provided value (small), the small
	  differences in the rate could result in very large differences in the
	  output time.
	  Fix by instead using both internal and external clock times based on the values
	  that gst_clock_get_calibration() will return. By doing so, small changes in the
	  rate calculations between the internal and external clock times will not result
	  in potentially large differences in the output internal time from
	  gst_clock_unadjust_with_calibration().

	  vkupload: use gst_buffer_find_memory() to select memory
	  We never implemented correctly the selection of memories in a buffer given the
	  plane.
	  This patch uses gst_buffer_find_memory() for that. The offset is checked via the
	  video meta either in the input and output buffers, or the default offset given
	  the format and size.
	  This patch also requests the video meta option for the output buffers.

	* gst-libs/gst/vulkan/gstvkimagebufferpool.c:
	  vkimagebufferpool: set video meta to buffers if requested
	  This patch adds the possibility to attach video metas to allocated buffers if
	  API users request that option.
	  The main reason to add this meta is for the future usage of
	  gst_buffer_find_memory(), where the requested offset determines the memory
	  index.
	  In the case of multi-memory Vulkan images the offset of every component is
	  larger than the default offset determined by the format and frame size, because
	  of the buffer minimum size and memory alignment determined by the used driver.
	  Then, the offset is set in the buffer video meta.
	  In the case of single memory Vulkan images, the default offset is set in the
	  video meta.

	  vulkanupload: fix regression for uploading VulkanBuffer
	  Merge request !5651 introduced a regression for uploading VulkanBuffer. It can
	  be verified by
	  gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! video/x-raw, format=NV12 ! vulkanupload ! \
	  video/x-raw\(memory:VulkanBuffer\) ! fakesink
	  Nobody has complained about this regression, so we assume it's a very niche
	  use-case.
	  This patch solve the regression by instantiating a different buffer pool
	  depending on the output cap features, and configuring it accordingly.

	  The position is no longer duplicated across each pad and pad's segment. The

	  quickly repeated forward seeks do not cause the stream to seek from 0.
	  Reverse playback is expressly disallowed and an unnecessary extra flush of track
	  when seeking was removed.
	  A background task was added to periodically check on the current position and
	  the media source's buffering levels to keep the ready state up-to-date. The
	  source buffer no longer needs to trigger this update, it will happen whenever
	  the element state is READY or higher.

	* gst-libs/gst/mse/gstsourcebuffer.c:
	  gstsourcebuffer: Added locking, re-worked track feed task
	  Since the sample map/track buffer now iterates samples in batches corresponding
	  to each coded frame group, the logic to feed the tracks is simpler. For media
	  without delta frames, it's a special case where the coded frame groups are all
	  size 1.
	  Now, all it does is skip data until the keyframe group containing the seek point
	  is found, then feed the track queue with the current sample and all future
	  samples until EOS or cancellation.
	  Resync of the iterator when the underlying track is modified is not necessary
	  because the outer loop attempts to resume feeding track data from where it was
	  interrupted in case of modification.
	  Also, the track feed task struct now holds a weak ref to its parent source
	  buffer to allow the task to cancel itself in any situation where the source
	  buffer is destroyed before the task is shut down.
	  Media parsing activity in the append pipeline no longer triggers ready state
	  recalculation on the msesrc since the msesrc now has a background task that
	  updates the ready state periodically when it's active which is more efficient in
	  cases where there is a high volume of samples being processed by the media
	  parser.
	  Finally, updated to adapt to track buffer API changes. Some functions previously
	  passed in a lower bound for sample timestamps. Now the source buffer is
	  responsible for clipping samples within a desired range of time.

	  gstmediasourcesamplemap: Re-worked sample iteration and removal
	  Both operations now work on coded frame groups (GOPs). This simplifies queueing
	  of video data. There is rarely any point of dealing with individual video frames
	  when iterating in DTS order, it's most meaningful to decode or delete whole
	  coded frame groups at a time, so the sample map will now do that when iterating
	  by DTS. When iterating in PTS order, the existing behavior is preserved since
	  that is used for informational purposes, not media processing.
	  A new private boxed type for coded frame groups was added to provide each data
	  item to the source buffer. Another possible solution would be creation of a new
	  GstSample representing the whole group by merging all the samples in a group
	  into a single sample containing a GstBufferList.
	  Also, start time filtering was removed from the API since gst_iterator_filter()
	  can be used by callers to achieve the same result.

	  vtenc: Avoid deadlocking when changing properties on the fly
	  VT supports changing properties on the fly, and old code attempted to
	  support that. Perhaps 10 years ago that worked, but these days
	  VTSessionSetProperty will always wait for the output callback to finish
	  before proceeding. This means that it's very prone to deadlocking, as
	  property setters will take the object lock, the callback thread will
	  take the stream lock, and the main (streaming) thread attempts to take
	  both, resulting in a deadlock.
	  New version uses something similar to other encoders (e.g. x264enc) -
	  changing a property when a session is already created will just flag it

	* sys/uvcgadget/uvc.c:
	  uvcgadget: Properly implement GET_INFO control responses
	  According to the UVC 1.5 specification, section 4.1.2, the GET_INFO request
	  must return a bitmap indicating supported operations for the control.
	  Value 0x00 indicates that neither GET nor SET operations are supported.
	  This patch fixes control handling in the UVC gadget implementation to properly
	  respond to GET_INFO requests with the correct bitmap, allowing host systems
	  to properly detect supported control operations (none in this case).
	  The pipeline I'm using to test this is:
	  gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! uvcsink v4l2sink::device=/dev/video0
	  This is the equivalent of [0] but the difference is that we are now returning
	  0x00 instead of 0x03.
	  Without this change the host in my case is unable to probe the UVC gadget at
	  all, automatically disconnecting the device after a few seconds.
	  Following is the log when the gadget is not working (without this fix):
	  usb 1-1.2: new high-speed USB device number 73 using xhci_hcd

	  v4l2codecs: Sort formats to avoid quality lost
	  When the driver prefered format is not picked by downstream, the
	  decoders needs to select another format from the list. The selection
	  was currently unsorted, resulting in 10bit data often being stripped
	  to 8bit.
	  To solve this, reorder the formats in an HW preference order. This order
	  deviates slightly from the preferred order in libgstvideo. This is to
	  prefer bandwidth saving over better CPU alignment. As an example NV15 is
	  prefered over P010. We also prefer tiled over linear.

	  nvencoder: Add extern-cuda-bufferpool property
	  Add new property to support application allocated GstCudaMemory.
	  CUDA memory alloc/free is a global device synchronization point
	  as if launching CUDA kernel on default CUDA stream. To avoid the global
	  synchronization, we added stream-ordered allocation support
	  which allocates CUDA memory asynchronously.
	  However, NVENC does not allow registering the stream-ordered
	  allocated memory. Thus encoder was allocating normal CUDA
	  memory in case that input CUDA memory is stream-ordered type.
	  In this commit, newly introduced property will allow application
	  to provide encoder with GstCudaBufferPool. Application can
	  preallocate sufficient amount of CUDA memory in advance
	  to avoid global device synchronization while pipeline is running.
	  For now, this pool is used only if input CUDA memory is allocated
	  via stream-ordered-allocation

	  With this patch, configure time is identical no matter whether doc is
	  enabled or not.
	  The configuration files also now contain explicitly-listed sources with
	  no wildcards.
	  For the four libraries where hotdoc needs to use clang to generate the
	  documentation (as opposed to the rest of the libraries where hotdoc uses
	  the gir), the script will call pkg-config to determine the appropriate
	  C flags.
	  This means a side effect of this patch is that pkg-config files are now
	  generated for the gstadaptivedemux and gstopencv libraries.

	  webrtc: fix duplicate payload types with RTX and multiple video codecs
	  Before this patch, there could be duplicate payload types in offers that
	  have, within a media section, multiple codecs and RTX enabled:
	  ```
	  m=video 9 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 96 97 97 <-- HAS DUPLICATES
	  a=sendrecv
	  a=rtpmap:96 VP8/90000
	  a=rtcp-fb:96 nack
	  a=rtcp-fb:96 nack pli
	  a=rtcp-fb:96 ccm fir
	  a=rtcp-fb:96 transport-cc
	  a=rtpmap:97 H264/90000
	  a=rtcp-fb:97 nack
	  a=rtcp-fb:97 nack pli
	  a=rtcp-fb:97 ccm fir
	  a=rtcp-fb:97 transport-cc
	  a=rtpmap:97 rtx/90000  <--------- PT IS DUPLICATE
	  a=fmtp:97 apt=96
	  ```
	  Fix this by populating the media_mapping array with all media formats
	  rather than only the first one. The added test case reproduces the issue,
	  which fails without this patch.

	  mssdemux: Use gsturi structure to form fragment urls
	  We can use gst_uri_from_string_with_base () to join base url
	  and the fragment url path.
	  The previous method of forming base url in update_base_url(),
	  by looking for the string 'manifest' or 'Manifest' is insufficient.
	  A query may include these string in their paths and thus an invalid

	  The main difference with the WIP av1-in-mpegts mapping is that the payload data

	  * Custom AV1G (AV1 Gstreamer) registration descriptor instead of AV01
	  * AV1CodecConfigurationRecord is stored in the same 0x80 custom descriptor and
	  conforms fully to the isobmff spec (i.e. does not the HDR fields from the

	  * Data is stored as OBU
	  * Access Unit is the frame level (same as provisional mpegts mapping)

	  v4l2codecs: decoder: Translate V4L2 formats into DRM fourcc/mod pairs
	  V4L2 and DRM choose different, incompatible ways to represent
	  tiled/compressed etc. formats. While the later uses combinations of
	  format fourccs and opaque, vendor/hardware specific modifiers, for the
	  later every such combination is a distinct new format.
	  Traditionally Gst implemented each of the V4L2 formats if needed.
	  Given the large number of tiling and compression modes, this is
	  quite work intensive - and often actually not needed.
	  In many situations Gst just needs to pass buffers from V4L2 to DRM in
	  the form of EGL, VK, Wayland or KMS.
	  Thus implement a direct translation for some V4L2 formats to DRM ones,
	  limited to the DMA_DRM API, allowing much quicker enablement of formats
	  while requiring peers to use external implementations (usually Mesa or
	  KMS) for tiling etc.

	  vulkan: store in GstVulkanVideoCapabilities encoder and decoder caps
	  The structure already stored the generic video capabilities and the specific
	  codec capabilities both for encoding an decoding. The generic decoder
	  capabilities weren't stored because it was only used internally in the decoder
	  helper object. Nonetheless, for the encoder, the elements will need the generic
	  encoder capabilities to configure the encoding. That's why it's required to
	  expose it as part of GstVulkanVideoCapabilities. And the generic decoder is

	  GstTensor contained two fields (data, dims) that were dynamicallay allocated. For

	  dims it's a small array to store the dimension of the tensor. The dims field
	  can be allocated inplace by moving it at the end of the structure. This will
	  allow a better memory management when GstTensor is stored in an analytics meta
	  which will take advantage of the _clear interface for re-use.
	  - New api to allocate and free GstTensor
	  To continue to support use-cases where GstTensor is not stored in an
	  analytics-meta we provide gst_tensor_alloc, gst_tensor_alloc_n and
	  gst_tensor_free that will facilitate memory management.

	  LCEVC data can be either part of the video stream as SEI NAL Units, or attached

	  uvcsink: make gst_v4l2uvc_fourcc_to_bare_struct work with more raw formats
	  The uvcsink was limited to only transfer YUY2 and MJPEG. For the
	  uncompressed formats there is no technical reason not to support them.
	  Since gst_video_format_to_string is already supporting more fourcc than
	  only YUY2 we use the default path in gst_v4l2uvc_fourcc_to_bare_struct
	  to create structures for more formats and bail out if the returned
	  format is not from the uncompressed type.

	  vtenc: Restart encoding session when certain errors are detected
	  Sometimes under certain loads, VT can error out with kVTVideoEncoderMalfunctionErr or kVTVideoEncoderNotAvailableNowErr.
	  These have been reported to happen more often than usual if CopyProperty/SetProperty() is used close to the encode call.
	  Both can be worked around by restarting the encoding session.
	  These errors can be returned either directly from VTCompressionSessionEncodeFrame() or later in the encoding callback.
	  This patch handles both scenarios the same way - a session restart is be attempted on the next encode_frame() call.
	  If the error is returned immediately by the encode call, it's possible that some correct frames will still be given to
	  the output callback, but for simplicity (+ because I wasn't able to verify this scenario) let's just discard those.
	  In addition, this commit also simplifies the beach/drop logic in enqueue_buffer.

	  webrtcbin: fix regression with missing RTP header extensions in Answer SDP
	  webrtcsrc first creates recvonly transceivers with codec-preferences
	  and expects that after applying a remote description, the
	  previously created transceivers are used rather than having new
	  transceivers created.
	  When pairing webrtcsink + webrtcsrc, the offer sdp from webrtcsink has a media
	  section with sendonly direction. In !7156, which was implemented following
	  RFC9429 Section 5.10, we only reuse a unassociated transceiver when applying a
	  remote description if the media is sendrecv or recvonly, and that caused creation
	  of new transceivers when applying a remote offer in webrtcsrc, thus losing
	  information from codec preferences like the RTP extension headers in the
	  previously created transceivers.
	  Since the change in !7156 broke existing code from webrtcsrc, relax the condition
	  for reusing unassociated transceivers and add a test to document this behavior which
	  wasn't covered by any tests before.
	  Fixes #3753.

	  A previous fix, a275e1e029e9b5d88be26b8304c9a162e4567346, is correct but was too

	  The problem this can cause is that some hardware decoders experience bad

	  webrtcbin: create and associate transceivers earlier in negotation
	  According to https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#set-the-session-description
	  (steps in 4.6.10.), we should be creating and associating transceivers when
	  setting session descriptions.
	  Before this commit, webrtcbin deviated from the spec:
	  1. Transceivers from sink pads where created when the sink pad was
	  requested, but not associated after setting local description, only
	  when signaling is STABLE.
	  2. Transceivers from remote offers were not created after applying the
	  the remote description, only when the answer is created, and were then
	  only associated once signaling is STABLE.
	  This commit makes webrtcbin follow the spec more closely with regards to
	  timing of transceivers creation and association.
	  A unit test is added, checking that the transceivers are created and
	  associated after every session description is set.

	  tsmux: Adjust byte counter when adjusting bitrate
	  When configured in constant bitrate mode, the muxer computes timing information
	  using the configured bitrate and the byte counter (now = bytes sent / byterate).
	  When an application changes the bitrate in CBR mode during playback, the
	  relationship between bytes sent and bitrate is no longer valid so new timing
	  values will be off by the ratio of the old bitrate to the new bitrate.
	  Furthermore, it will upset the way that padding is generated.
	  pad_stream() works by trying to fit the byte counter to now * byterate.
	  The result is that when decreasing bitrate, the muxer stalls, waiting until the
	  byte counter is in agreement with now * byterate. Also, when increasing
	  bitrate, the padding will spike in volume until the byte counter fits with
	  now * byterate.
	  If the byte counter is scaled by the ratio of new bitrate / old bitrate when

	  One detail this change doesn't yet address is whether the next PCR will match up

	  The code is simplified by using GQuarks for looking for caps features, and

	  is cheaper at the beginning of negotiation, where the pad template caps is used.

	  According to the SPEC:
	  The frame id numbers (represented in display_frame_id, current_frame_id,
	  and RefFrameId[ i ]) are not needed by the decoding process, but allow
	  decoders to spot when frames have been missed and take an appropriate action.
	  So we should just print out warning and should not return error in parser when
	  mismatching. The decoder itself is already robust to handle the reference missing.

	  d3d12videosink: Add support for window handle update
	  A large refactoring commit for adding features and improve performance
	  * Reuse internal converter and overlay compositor:
	  Converter can be reused as long as input and display formats are not
	  changed. Also overlay compositor reconstruction is required only if
	  display format is changed
	  * Don't wait for full GPU flush on resize or close:
	  D3D12 swapchain requires GPU idle in order to resize backbuffer.
	  Thus CPU side waiting is required for swapchain related commands
	  to be finished. However, don't need to wait for full GPU flushing.
	  * Support multiple sink on a single external window
	  Keep installed subclass window procedure even if there's no associated
	  our internal HWND. This will make window procedure hooking less racy.
	  Then parent HWND's message will be transferred to our internal HWNDs
	  if needed.
	  * Adding support for window handle update
	  Application can change target HWND even when videosink is playing or
	  paused state. So, users can call gst_video_overlay_set_window_handle()
	  against d3d12videosink anytime. The videosink will be able to update
	  internal state and setup resource upon requested.

	  From quick testing, this makes seeking more reliable (previously, it would sometimes cause a decoding error

	  vtenc: Enable HEVC with alpha encoding
	  Adds a separate vtenc_h265a element (with a _hw variant as usual) for the HEVCWithAlpha codec type.
	  Decided to go with a separate element to not break existing uses of the normal HEVC encoder.
	  The preserve_alpha property is still only used for ProRes, no need for it here because we explicitly say we want alpha
	  when using the new element.
	  For now, the HEVCWithAlpha has an issue where it does not throttle the amount of input frames queued internally.
	  I added a quick workaround where encode_frame() will block until enqueue_frame() callback notifies it that some space
	  has been freed up in the internal queue. The limit was set to 5, which should be enough I guess? Hopefully this is not
	  too prone to race conditions.

	  vkformat: try UNORM format first and decouple them from colorimetry
	  From the spec (chapter 34, v1.3.283):
	  ````
	  UNORM: the components are unsigned normalized values in the range [0, 1]
	  SRGB: the R, G and B components are unsigned normalized value that represent
	  values using sRGB nonlinear encoding, while the A component (if one
	  exists) is a regular unsigned normalized value
	  ```
	  The difference is the storage encoding, the first one is aimed for image
	  transfers, while the second is for shaders, mostly in the swapchain stage in the
	  pipeline, and it's done automatically if needed [1].
	  As far as I have checked, other frameworks (FFmpeg, GTK+), when import or export
	  images from/to Vulkan, use exclusively UNORM formats, while SRGB formats are
	  ignored.
	  My conclusion is that Vulkan formats are related on how bits are stored in
	  memory rather their transfer functions (colorimetry).
	  This patch does two interrelated changes:
	  1. It swaps certain color format maps to try first, in both
	  gst_vulkan_format_from_video_info() and gst_vulkan_format_from_video_info_2(),
	  the UNORM formats, when comparing its usage, and later check for SRGB.
	  2. It removes the code that check for colorimetry in
	  gst_vulkan_format_from_video_info_2(), since it not storage related.

	  v4l2codecs: decoder: Reorder caps to prefer DMA_DRM ones
	  Certain V4L2 fourccs don't (yet) have DRM counter parts, in which case
	  we can't create DMA_DRM caps for them. This is usually the case for
	  specific tilings, which are represented as modifiers for DMA formats.
	  While using these tilings is generally preferable - because of e.g.
	  lower memory usage - it can result in additional conversion steps when
	  interacting with DMA based APIs such as GL, Vulkan or KMS. In such cases
	  using a DMA compatible format usually ends up being the better option.
	  Before the addition of DMA_DRM caps, this was what playbin3 ended up
	  requesting in various cases - e.g. prefering NV12 over NV12_4L4 - but
	  the addition of DMA_DRM caps seems to confuse the selection logic.
	  As a simple and quite robust solution, assume that peers supporting
	  DMA_DRM caps always prefer these and reorder the caps accordingly.
	  In the future we plan to have a translation layer for cases where
	  there is a matching fourcc+modifier pair for a V4L2 fourcc, ensuring
	  optimal results.

	  rsvg: Disable deprecations instead of porting to new librsvg API
	  `rsvg_handle_get_dimensions()` and `rsvg_handle_render_cairo()` are
	  deprecated, and the replacement librsvg functions as specified in the
	  migration guide are `rsvg_handle_get_intrinsic_size_in_pixels()` and
	  `rsvg_handle_render_document()`.
	  However, those are not drop-in replacements, and actually have
	  breaking semantics for our use-case:
	  1. `intrinsic_size_in_pixels()` requires SVGs to have width+height or
	  the viewBox attribute, but `get_dimensions()` does not. It will
	  calculate the geometry based on element extents recursively.
	  2. `render_cairo()` simply renders the SVG at its intrinsic size on
	  the specified surface starting at the top-left, maintaining
	  whatever transformations have been applied to the cairo surface,
	  including distorted aspect ratio.
	  However, `render_document()` does not do that, it is specifically
	  for rendering at the specified aspect ratio inside the specified
	  viewport, and if you specify a viewPort that does not match the
	  aspect ratio of the SVG, librsvg will center it.
	  Matching the old behaviour with the new APIs is a lot of work for no
	  benefit. We'd be duplicating code that is already there in librsvg in
	  one case and undoing work that librsvg is doing in the other case.
	  The aspect ratio handling in this element is also kinda atrocious.
	  There is no option to scale the SVG while maintaining the aspect
	  ratio. Overall, element needs a rewrite.
	  Let's just disable deprecations. The API is not going anywhere.

	  Sometimes a call to negotiate (and thus drain) can happen from the output loop

	  if we happen to decide to wait for the queue to empty (because the loop is waiting for draining to finish and
	  will not make space in the queue!). This commit adds an override for the queue size limit if we're draining/flushing.
	  This bug could happen for any formats, but was especially obvious for ProRes, which has dpb_size of 0.

	  va{h264,h265,av1}enc: fix potential crash on devices without rate control
	  This fixes a crash in `gst_va_h264_enc_class_init` and `gst_va_h265_enc_class_init`
	  (and probably also in gst_va_av1_enc_class_init) when calling
	  `g_object_class_install_properties (object_class, n_props, properties);`
	  When rate_control_type is 0, the following code is executed in :
	  ```
	  } else {
	  n_props--;
	  properties[PROP_RATE_CONTROL] = NULL;
	  }
	  ```
	  n_props has initially a value of N_PROPERTIES but PROP_RATE_CONTROL
	  is not the last element in the array, so it's making
	  g_object_class_install_properties fail to iterate over the
	  properties array.
	  This applies the same fix to gstvah264enc.c, gstvah265enc.c and
	  gstvaav1enc.c.

	  webrtc: add all SSRC attributes getting CAPS for a PT
	  The transport stream only returned the CAPS for the first matching PT entry
	  from the `ptmap`. Other SSRC with the same PT where not included. For a stream
	  which bundled multiple audio streams for instance, only the first SSRC was
	  knowed to the SSRC demux and downstream elements.
	  This commit adds all the `ssrc-` attributes from the matching PT entries.
	  The RTP jitter buffer can now find the CNAME corresponding its SSRC even if it
	  was not the first to be registered for a particular PT.
	  The RTP PT demux removes `ssrc-*` attributes cooresponding to other SSRCs
	  before pushing SSRC specific CAPS to downstream elements.

	  rtponviftimestamp: Use gst_segment_to_stream_time_full()
	  In the situation where playback starts from a keyframe before

	  outside the configured segment and gst_segment_to_stream_time()
	  will return GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE unconditionally.
	  If drop-out-of-segment is false, the RTP buffers will not be
	  dropped, but will be sent witout ONVIF extension timestamps
	  and given GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE timestamps on the receiver.
	  Instead, use gst_segment_to_stream_time_full() to extrapolate
	  stream time outside the segment so that such buffers still
	  get assigned their correct timestamps on the receiver.

	  Provide a clock from the source that is a monotonic system clock with
	  the rate corrected based on the measured and ideal capture rate of the
	  frames.
	  If this clock is selected as pipeline clock, then provide perfect
	  timestamps to downstream.
	  Otherwise, if the pipeline clock is the monotonic system clock, use the
	  internal clock for converting back to the monotonic system clock.
	  Otherwise, use the monotonic system clock time calculated in the above
	  case and convert that to the pipeline clock.
	  In all cases this will give a smoother time than the previous code,
	  which simply took the difference between the driver provided capture
	  time and the current real-time clock time, and applied that to the
	  current pipeline clock time.
